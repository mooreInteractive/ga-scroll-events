ga-scroll-events
================

Track Scrolling behaviours from users through Google Analytics. 

Script will track an event when the user starts, hits 25%, 50%, 75%, or end of the page. 

It will only track each section once per page. Non-interaction value is set to true by default. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions, or suggestions. This is a script I made for work, and decided to adjust for personal use.
